### Day 4: Aug 4, 2018
**Today's progress**: Started on the typing test app. Setup the page layout. Used vue binding to get user input + display text to type. Idea is to display a random string that the challenger needs to type. Will measure speed and accuracy when the user submits.

### Day 5: Aug 5, 2018
**Today's progress**: Added keyboard view to the page. Keys will be highlighted on keyboard when pressed.

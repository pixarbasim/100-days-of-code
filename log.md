### Day 4: Aug 4, 2018
**Today's progress**: Started on the typing test app. Setup the page layout. Used vue binding to get user input + display text to type. Idea is to display a random string that the challenger needs to type. Will measure speed and accuracy when the user submits.

### Day 5: Aug 5, 2018
**Today's progress**: Added keyboard view to the page. Keys will be highlighted on keyboard when pressed.

### Day 6: August 6, 2018
**Today's progress**: Faced some struggle today trying to bind key presses to visible keyboard on screen. Currently, I am using a json object for all the keys in a row along with there shift keys. Could not figure out how to change styles of a particular button when pressed to highlight. Will try creating a vue template for each key.


### Day 7: August 8, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Defined a vue component to represent the keyboard key. Was stuck with some syntax level things. Thought it would be better to read on it a little on the vue official documentation (quite good). Also watched 3 videos from the website matthew learning on.

### Day 8: August 9, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Made the keyboard view responsive to text. Highlighting the keys on the view when pressed. More understanding about functions and passing props like style class dynamically to vue components.

**Today's Progress**: Started with an introduction to the most basic features of Vue.js core (https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).

**Thoughts:** Plan to build a Typing test application using Vue.js. I have good experience in React.js and wanted to try out Vue.js.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)
